# work-day-planner
I am making a day to day planner that shows the date and allows the user to save what they are doing for the day

Disclaimer
I am very unhappy with my work here. I was struggling with ways to get this to work and I have an understanding of how to do it but I am struggling with the skills of implementation. It isn't good and the code doesnt even work. The JavaScript is very bad, you will notice, trust me. You will look at it and know what I am trying to do. I will be seeking a better way to do this, but looking it up hasn't led me very far.
